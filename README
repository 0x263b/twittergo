This project implements a Go client library for the Twitter APIs.

Status:
-----------------------------
The main executable, as built by the Makefile will probably demonstrate the
current functionality of the library.

Supported:
    * Going through Twitter's OAuth flow and obtaining tokens
    * Deserializing statuses, users
    * Fetching public timelines
    * Fetching OAuth-protected timelines
    * Posting text-only updates

The main executable now implements the beginnings of a sophisticated
command-line client.  Multiple accounts are supported, and the OAuth flow
is triggered if you haven't authorized the app yet.  Commands map to the
REST API endpoints, and you can browse through them using up/down arrows.


Requirements:
-----------------------------
The main client is primarily tested on Linux and secondarily on Mac.

The library should be pretty portable, the main executable may not be.

Install the following:
  Go:    http://golang.org
  Godag: http://code.google.com/p/godag/

Set up your $GO* env variables as described here:
http://golang.org/doc/install.html#environment before installing godag.


Building
-----------------------------
Run the following from the project root:

  make build

The executable will be in build/main
